# OpenChat Security Fixes Summary

This document outlines all critical security vulnerabilities that have been identified and fixed in the OpenChat codebase. These fixes address the highest priority security issues to make the application production-ready.

## 🔴 Critical Security Fixes Implemented

### 1. Hardcoded Credentials Removed ✅

**Issue**: Docker Compose files contained hardcoded passwords and credentials in plain text.

**Files Fixed**:
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Implemented Docker secrets for all services
- `/docker-compose.electric.yml` - Converted to secure secrets-based configuration

**Security Improvements**:
- All database passwords now use Docker secrets (`/run/secrets/*`)
- JWT secrets moved to secure file-based storage
- Admin interface passwords secured with secrets
- Database URLs constructed securely using secret references

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# Before (INSECURE)
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD: openchat_dev

# After (SECURE)
environment:
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE: /run/secrets/postgres_password
secrets:
  - postgres_password
```

### 2. Secure Secret Management System ✅

**Issue**: JWT and authentication secrets had insecure fallback values and weak validation.

**Files Created**:
- `/scripts/security/generate-secrets.ts` - Cryptographically secure secret generator
- `/apps/server/src/lib/security/env-validation.ts` - Comprehensive environment validation

**Security Improvements**:
- Cryptographically secure secret generation (Web Crypto API)
- No fallback secrets allowed - applications fail securely
- Secret strength validation (minimum length, entropy checks)
- Automatic secret rotation capabilities
- Secure file permissions (600) enforced

**JWT Security Enhanced**:
```typescript
// Before (INSECURE)
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET || process.env.BETTER_AUTH_SECRET || "fallback-secret";

// After (SECURE)
const secret = process.env.JWT_SECRET;
if (!secret || secret.length < 32) {
  throw new Error("JWT_SECRET is required and must be at least 32 characters long");
}
if (secret.includes('fallback') || secret.includes('example')) {
  throw new Error("JWT_SECRET appears to be a placeholder value");
}
```

### 3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Fixed ✅

**Issue**: Dynamic SQL queries used string concatenation instead of parameterized queries.

**Files Fixed**:
- `/apps/server/src/index.ts` - Fixed user search NOT IN clause
- `/apps/server/src/routers/user-profile.ts` - Fixed user exclusion queries

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/server/src/lib/security/sql-safety.ts` - Comprehensive SQL safety utilities

**Security Improvements**:
- All dynamic SQL queries now use proper parameterization
- Safe IN/NOT IN clause generation with parameter binding
- SQL injection pattern detection and blocking
- Secure LIKE clause construction with proper escaping
- Safe ORDER BY and pagination utilities

**Example Fix**:
```typescript
// Before (VULNERABLE)
conditions.push(sql`${user.id} NOT IN (${blockedUserIds.join(',')})`);

// After (SECURE)
const { safeNotIn } = await import('./lib/security/sql-safety');
conditions.push(safeNotIn(user.id, blockedUserIds));
```

### 4. Command Injection Prevention ✅

**Issue**: System command execution without proper input sanitization and validation.

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/server/src/lib/security/command-execution.ts` - Secure command execution utilities

**Security Improvements**:
- Whitelist-based command execution (only allowed commands can run)
- Input sanitization and validation for all command arguments
- Command injection pattern detection and blocking
- Safe argument escaping and quoting
- Execution logging and monitoring
- Timeout and resource limits for command execution

**Security Features**:
- Command whitelisting prevents execution of dangerous commands
- Pattern matching blocks command injection attempts
- Safe Docker command execution with additional validation
- Database command execution with SQL injection prevention

### 5. Production-Safe Environment Detection ✅

**Issue**: Development-only features could be enabled in production through environment manipulation.

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/server/src/lib/security/environment-detection.ts` - Multi-factor environment analysis

**Files Updated**:
- `/apps/server/src/lib/dev-auth.ts` - Uses secure environment detection
- `/apps/server/src/index.ts` - Environment validation on startup

**Security Improvements**:
- Multi-factor environment detection (NODE_ENV, URLs, database config, security settings)
- Fail-safe defaults (defaults to production security when uncertain)
- Confidence scoring for environment detection
- Production indicator detection prevents development bypass
- Comprehensive audit logging of security decisions

**Security Logic**:
```typescript
// Fail-safe approach - defaults to production security
if (info.confidence === 'low') {
  console.warn('Environment detection confidence is low - defaulting to production security');
  return false;
}

if (info.isProduction || info.securityLevel === 'strict') {
  return false; // Never allow development features in production
}
```

### 6. Comprehensive Input Validation and Sanitization ✅

**Issue**: User input was not properly validated and sanitized, allowing potential XSS and injection attacks.

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/server/src/lib/security/input-validation.ts` - Comprehensive input validation system

**Security Improvements**:
- XSS prevention with HTML sanitization
- Email, URL, and username validation with security checks
- File path validation to prevent path traversal attacks
- JSON validation with circular reference detection
- UUID format validation
- Dangerous pattern detection across all input types
- Zod schema integration for type-safe validation

**Validation Coverage**:
- HTML content sanitization (removes dangerous tags/attributes)
- SQL injection pattern detection in text inputs
- Command injection prevention in all user inputs
- Path traversal prevention in file operations
- LDAP injection prevention
- Size limits to prevent DoS attacks

## 🛡️ Security Architecture Improvements

### Environment Variable Validation on Startup

The application now validates all security-critical environment variables on startup:
- Blocks startup if critical security variables are missing
- Validates secret strength and format
- Detects placeholder/example values
- Provides detailed error messages for security issues

### Multi-Layer Security Approach

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Docker secrets, secure networking, proper permissions
2. **Application Layer**: Environment validation, secure authentication, input validation
3. **Database Layer**: Parameterized queries, connection security, access controls
4. **API Layer**: Request validation, rate limiting, security headers

### Fail-Safe Security Defaults

All security implementations follow a "fail-safe" approach:
- When in doubt, apply the most restrictive security policy
- Default to production security settings
- Block operations rather than allow with warnings
- Comprehensive logging for security decisions

### Environment Variables Security

**Required Security Variables** (no fallbacks allowed):
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Must be 32+ characters, cryptographically secure
- `JWT_SECRET` - Must be 32+ characters, no placeholder values
- `DATABASE_URL` - Must use secure connection parameters

**Production Security Requirements**:
- HTTPS URLs mandatory (`BETTER_AUTH_URL` must start with `https://`)
- Secure cookies enabled (`USE_SECURE_COOKIES=true`)
- Non-wildcard CORS origins (`CORS_ORIGIN` cannot be `*`)
- SSL database connections required

## 🔧 Usage Instructions

### 1. Generate Development Secrets
```bash
bun scripts/security/generate-secrets.ts generate
```

### 2. Start with Docker Secrets
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Validate Security Configuration
The application automatically validates security configuration on startup and will refuse to start if critical security issues are detected.

### 4. Monitor Security Logs
All security decisions and validations are logged for monitoring:
```
[SECURITY] Environment analysis completed: {...}
[SECURE-EXEC] Executing: docker ps
[DEV-AUTH] Development environment check: {...}
```

## ⚠️ Important Security Warnings

### For Development
- All generated secrets are for **DEVELOPMENT ONLY**
- Never commit secret files to version control (`.gitignore` is configured)
- Rotate secrets regularly during development
- Development features are automatically disabled in production

### For Production
